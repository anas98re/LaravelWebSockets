Require the Laravel WebSockets package. It works as a replacement for external services like Pusher. Many settings will refer to Pusher today but be reminded that we are not using it. We want our own solution.

Next, adapt your .env file. We want the BROADCAST_DRIVER to be pusher.

We can define all those values ourselves. We are not actually using Pusher, but the package uses these keys, making replacing Pusher (if you use it) as simple as possible.
